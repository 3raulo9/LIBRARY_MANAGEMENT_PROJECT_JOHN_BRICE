## How to use

To start off, you have to create a virtual environment. You can do it by following the next steps:

1. Install the virtual environment package:
   ```
   pip install virtualenv
   ```

2. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```

3. Create a new virtual environment in your project directory:
   ```
   virtualenv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On Unix or MacOS:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

Now, you are in your virtual environment and can start installing packages for your project.
```
Please replace `/path/to/your/project` with the actual path to your project directory. The name `venv` is just an example, you can name your virtual environment as you wish.


Sure, here is the instruction to install the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

```markdown
## Installing Packages

After activating your virtual environment, you can install the required packages using the `requirements.txt` file. Here are the steps:

1. Ensure that you are in the project directory where `requirements.txt` is located.
   ```shell
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```

2. Use pip to install the packages:
   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

This command will install all the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
```
Please replace `/path/to/your/project` with the actual path to your project directory. Make sure your `requirements.txt` file is in the project directory.



### Project Description
mySQL tables:
1. Books
   - Id (PK)
   - Name
   - Author
   - Year Published
   - Type (1/2/3)
2. Customers
   - Id (PK)
   - Name
   - City
   - Age
3. Loans

   - BookID
   - Loan date
   - Return date

### Loan Duration
The book type determines the maximum loan time:
- Type 1: up to 10 days
- Type 2: up to 5 days
- Type 3: up to 2 days

### DAL (Data Access Layer)
1. Build a class for each entity (Books, Customers, Loans).
2. Create a separate module for each class.
3. Develop unit tests for the DAL.

### Client Application
Build a client application to interact with the DAL. Implement the following operations and display them in a simple menu:
1. Add a new customer
2. Add a new book
3. Loan a book
4. Return a book
5. Display all books
6. Display all customers
7. Display all loans
8. Display late loans
9. Find book by name
